# nba_twitter_bot
Python script that calls NBA_api and broadcasts live scores to twitter using the Twitter API

This script uses the nba_api found on https://github.com/swar/nba_api. Specifically, the NBA Live Stats endpoint. This is a great API for easy calls for live NBA stats, but the documentation for the JSON responses are out-of-date.
